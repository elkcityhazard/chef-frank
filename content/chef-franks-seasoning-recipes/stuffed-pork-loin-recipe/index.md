Stuffed pork loin with fresh raspberry sauce is a wonderful Holiday or Fall entree. The stuffing can be made with either walnuts or pecans. for presentation, slice and shingle onto a platter or tray.

## Stuffed Pork Loin With Raspberry Sauce

### Stuffing:

  * 4 c water
  * 2tsp chicken base
  * 1/2 lg. onion diced
  * 2 ribs celery diced
  * 1 tsp Chef Frank&#8217;s Seasoning
  * 2 tbsp sage
  * 2 apples, peeled, diced
  * 1/2 stick butter
  * 1 c chopped pecans

Place all ingredients above in medium sauce pan. Slow boil for 1/2 hour. then add:  
4-6 cups dried, cubed bread  
Add bread cubes slowly as not to get dressing too thick and pasty. Mix together.

### Pork Loin part:

Lay out pork loin and cut long ways and slowly work your way along making shallow cuts to open up loin. Place stuffing in opened loin and press onto meat. Carefully roll up loin and place toothpicks in meat to hold together. Place in roasting pan. Bake 325&#8457; uncovered for 1 1/2 hours. Serve.

**Note:** I have served this with raspberry sauce on top after removing from oven. Here is a quick recipe.

### Raspberry Sauce part

  * 2 cups raspberry / cranberry juice
  * 1 pint fresh raspberries
  * 2 tbsp corn starch

Place 1 1/2 c juice in sauce pan and bring to boil. Mix remainder of juice with corn starch and whisk slowly into boiling juice until desired thickness is reached. Pour over cooked pork loin then sprinkle raspberries over top. Slice and serve.
