**Prep time:** 15-20 minutes

**Bake time:** 40 minutes

**Yield:** 280 pieces

### Banana Bread Ingredients

  * 60 ripe peeled bananas
  * 20 c sugar
  * 10 c vegetable oil
  * 40 eggs
  * 2 tbsp vanilla
  * 1 tbsp salt
  * 1 c milk
  * 40 c flour
  * 3 tbsp baking powder
  * 3 tbsp baking soda

### Banana Bread Directions

In large 60 qt. mixer combine bananas and sugar. Mix until blended together. Add oil, vanilla, salt, milk, and eggs. Mix together until creamy yet with lumps of banana. Combine in separate bowl flour, baking powder and soda with wire whisk. Then add to wet ingredients in mixer. On speed #1(always check before turning on for safety) turn mixer on and off so as not to spray flour everywhere until flour starts to incorporate into mixture. Turn off mixer and scrape sides of mixer bowl. Turn mixer back on and mix batter only until all flour is incorporated. **Do not over mix.**

Grease four (4) full sized sheetpans and scale batter evenly among them. Place in pre-heated convection oven at 325&#8457; for 40 minutes. Check with toothpick as you may have to adjust time slightly. Each pan yields 70 pieces. Serve for breakfast when having oatmeal or eggs.

**Note:** if you do not have a 60 qt electric mixer, you may break the recipe in half and mix by hand. It really does not take much more time as quick breads mix up quickly.
