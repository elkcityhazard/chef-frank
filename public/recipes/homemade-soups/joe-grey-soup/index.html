<h2 id="traditional-gypsy-stew">Traditional Gypsy Stew</h2>
<p>Joe Grey is a traditional Gypsy stew often made with sausage and bacon but can be modified to fit whatever flavor profile, or ingredients in your refrigerator, that you might desire.</p>
<h2 id="joe-grey-history">Joe Grey History</h2>
<p>A popular dish in the Romany community, no one is sure of its origins. This recipe takes its inspiration from the wondering nature of the people who created it. It has a superb umami flavor due to the combination of meats and tomatoes. This makes it a beautiful fall addition to lift your spirits as the weather gets colder.<br>
The Romany people have their origins in India. Their cuisine borrows from other European countries. Paprika, garlic, bell peppers, and potatoes are a common staple in the Romany cuisine. In some ways, I assert Joe Grey to be simple and enduring much like a Hungarian Goulash. This is a loose comparison. It will remind you of Sunday Gravy as a child growing up.</p>
