<p>Curried Shrimp is a Quick Easy Seafood Recipe with Fresh Shrimp, Curry, and Vegetables. Curried Shrimp uses Different Curry Strengths to your Taste.</p>
<h2 id="shrimp-curry-recipe-ingredients">Shrimp Curry Recipe Ingredients</h2>
<p><strong>serves 8</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 lbs shrimp (raw 21-25 per lb. peeled deveined, remove tail)</li>
<li>1 onion large cut</li>
<li>1 green pepper large cut</li>
<li>1 lb fresh pea pods</li>
<li>1 lb bean sprouts</li>
<li>2 ribs celery angle cut</li>
<li>1 lb fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
<li>1/2 c flour</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>2 tbsp curry powder( or red paste if you like it hotter)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shrimp-curry-recipe-directions">Shrimp Curry Recipe Directions</h2>
<p>In large bowl, place shrimp flour and curry. Mix it up. In large frying pan, high heat, put olive oil (wait for pan to heat up a little). When olive oil starts to smoke, put in enough vegetables as not to crowd (to cause water to form in pan) and stir fry (frying at 450℉) moving food constantly. When vegetables change color slightly they are done (about 5 minutes). When all vegetables are cooked then cook shrimp in the same pan. It’s probably all sticky but when the shrimp are in the pan, put a touch of water in to lift the flavor off the pan. When shrimp is pinkish, it’s done. Mix with vegetables and serve.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> can be served with fettuccine and fried cabbage and onion. Also good with wild rice or couscous. (I’m getting hungry just thinking about it).</p>
